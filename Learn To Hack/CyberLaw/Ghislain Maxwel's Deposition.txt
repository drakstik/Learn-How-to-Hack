EXAMINATION BY

11

MS. McCAWLEY:

12

Q.

M A X W E L L,

called

having been duly sworn by a

Good morning.

I'm going to explain

13

some of the rules that will happen with

14

respect to depositions.

15

Have you ever been deposed before?

16

A.

I have not.

17

Q.

What is going to happen here, we

18

have a court reporter and a videographer.

19

What they do is take down the words that we

20

say so when I ask you a question they will

21

record what you say in response to that.

22

we have to be mindful that in order for them

23

to do their job we can't talk over each

24

other.

25

So

Another issue you have to be weary

 
Page 5
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

of is that in a response, you can't give a

3

nonverbal response, in other words, nodding a

4

yes or no, they need to hear verbal response

5

so they can record it on their transcript.

6

So that's important for you to remember as we

7

go through the day.

8

sure to remind you.

9

If you forget, I will be

Is there anything that would

10

prevent you from giving truthful testimony

11

today?

12

A.

There is not.

13

Q.

You are not on any medications or

14

anything that would inhibit your ability to

15

remember or give truthful testimony?

16

A.

17
18

I am not.
MR. PAGLIUCA:

Could you identify

the assistant in the room.

19

MS. McCAWLEY:

This is Emma Rosen

20

from our New York office.

21

paralegal.

22

Q.

23

She is a

Ms. Maxwell, can you please state

your address for the record?

24

A.

Currently

25

Q.

What is your date of birth?

A.

3

Q.

4
5

When did you first recruit a female

to work for Mr. Epstein?
MR. PAGLIUCA:

I object to the form

6

and foundation of the question.

7

believe this is confidential

8

information.

9

admitted in this case be excused from

10

I

I ask anyone who is not

the room, please.

11

MS. McCAWLEY:

So the response to

12

that question would --

13

MR. PAGLIUCA:

The subject matter

14

of this question is confidential and I'm

15

designating it as confidential.

16
17
18

MS. McCAWLEY:

I just want to make

that clear for the record.
MR. EDWARDS:

So we don't delay the

19

deposition I will step out of the room

20

but I think it's important to lay the

21

record that --

22

MR. PAGLIUCA:

I'm sorry, you are

23

not admitted in this proceeding so you

24

are not entitled to make any record.

25

Ms. McCawley wants to make a record she

If

 
Page 7

2

G Maxwell - Confidential
can.

3
4

MR. EDWARDS:

I can make a record

right now.

5

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Maybe we should get

6

the judge on the phone and talk about

7

it.

8
9

MR. EDWARDS:
short.

The record will be

This is the precise reason why

10

Ms. Giuffre wants me in this case and

11

I'm unable to effectively represent her

12

at this time because I am unable to have

13

access to the confidential information

14

which includes apparently the entire

15

deposition of Ms. Maxwell.

16

sake of not further delaying this, I

17

will be outside the room.

18
19
20

MS. McCAWLEY:
A.

But for the

Thank you.

I would like to just -- wait for

him to leave.

21

Q.

That's fine.

22

A.

I would just like to clarify the

23

address.

I'm in the process of selling the

24

house so while while I still receive mail

25

there, it's not my actual physical address.

 
Page 8
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

It's in the process of being sold.

3

requires some final paperwork to be done, so

4

just for the purposes of clarity.

5
6

Q.

It still

Do you have a new address where you

will be living?

7

A.

I do not.

8

Q.

For the purpose of the record, if

9

there is something I ask you that you later

10

remember something else or need to correct

11

your testimony in some way, you can do that,

12

just let me know what it is and we will go

13

back to that question and can you clarify.

14

A.

Of course.

I just wanted to be

15

clear, there is still some paperwork pending

16

for final release, but it's in the process of

17

sale.

18

currently, so whilst that should still be of

19

record that the mail could be forwarded

20

there, so for purposes of clarity I wanted to

21

be clear.

22
23
24
25

But I don't have another address

Q.

I appreciate that.
So Ms. Maxwell, when did you first

recruit a female to work for Mr. Epstein?
MR. PAGLIUCA:

Again.

I object to

 
Page 9
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

form and foundation of the question.

3

Q.

You can answer the question.

4

A.

First of all, can you please

5

clarify the question.

6

what you mean by female, I don't understand

7

what you mean by recruit.

8

clear and specific about what you are

9

suggesting.

10
11

Q.

I don't understand

Please be more

Are you a female, is that the sex

that you are?

12

A.

I am a female.

13

Q.

That's what I'm referring to a

14

female and I'm asking you when you first, the

15

very first time you recruited a female to

16

work for Mr. Epstein?

17
18
19

A.

Again, I don't understand what

female -- I am a 54 year old women.
Q.

I'm not making it age, any age of a

20

female that you recruited to work for Mr.

21

Epstein?

22

A.

Again, I was somebody who hired a

23

number of people to work for Mr. Epstein and

24

hiring is one of my functions.

25

Q.

And when is the first time you

 
Page 10
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

hired someone to work for Mr. Epstein, a

3

female?

4

A.

As best as I can recollect, a woman

5

the age probably of about 40 or 50 was in

6

sometime in 1992.

7
8
9

Q.

How long did you work for Mr.

Epstein?
A.

I started working for him at some

10

point in 1992 and the nature of my work

11

relationship with him changed over time so

12

from around 2002, 2003, the work lessened

13

considerably.

14

Q.

15

When did you -MR. PAGLIUCA:

16

17

background --

18

Can I interject for

If we are talking about

MS. McCAWLEY:

19

a question.

20

can you interject.

21

Q.

I'm in the middle of

Let me finish it and then

When you say 2002 to 2003 that the

22

work lessened, when did you complete working

23

for Mr. Epstein; when was the last time you

24

were employed by him, the last date?

25

A.

I believe I still was doing --

 
Page 11
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

helping him in a very nominal way, maybe an

3

hour or two a year at sometime 2008 and 2009.

4

MR. PAGLIUCA:

So if you are going

5

to be talking about general background,

6

I don't need to designate that as

7

confidential.

8

them come back in, that's fine.

9

So if you want to have

I assumed by your first question

10

you were going into more sensitive

11

areas.

12

if this is general background it will

13

not be designated as confidential.

14

I will leave it up to you, but

MS. McCAWLEY:

I appreciate that.

15

I will jump back into my other

16

questions.

17

MR. PAGLIUCA:

18

as confidential.

19

Q.

20
21

So we will keep it

When you were first employed by him

in 1992, what were you hired to do?
A.

First, I was consulting and what I

22

did was I helped with decorating houses and

23

in hiring staff to help run those houses.

24
25

Q.

Did your duties change over the

course of 1992 to 2009?

 
Page 12

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

MR. PAGLIUCA:

3

and foundation.

4

A.

Object to the form

My job entailed running the homes

5

that he had but much more importantly, most

6

of the houses had construction and so whilst

7

in 1992 there was no construction project,

8

there was construction projects that began

9

after that time and I was in charge not only

10

of hiring architects, I was also in charge of

11

all the filings or overseeing that, like a

12

general contractor would.

13

I also helped with hiring the

14

architects, hiring the builders, reviewing

15

the contracts for the builders, coordinating

16

the building projects, coordinating how the

17

projects would layout, the timing of the

18

projects and all the various materials that

19

they would require to run a very substantial

20

building project.

21

job I was dealing with.

22
23
24
25

Q.

That's the nature of the

How old was the youngest female you

ever hired to work for Jeffrey?
MR. PAGLIUCA:

Object to the form

 
Page 13

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

Q.

You can answer.

3

A.

I have not any idea exactly of the

4

youngest adult employee that I hired for

5

Jeffrey.

6

Q.

When you say adult employee, did

7

you ever hire someone that was under the age

8

of 18?

9

A.

Never.

10

Q.

Did you ever bring someone who was

11

under -- invite someone under the age of 18

12

to Jeffrey's home, any of his homes?

13

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Object to the form

14

foundation.

15

A.

Can you repeat the question?

16

Q.

Did you ever invite anybody who was

17

under the age of 18 to Jeffrey's homes?

18
19

MR. PAGLIUCA:
A.

Same objections.

I have a number of friends that

20

have children and friends of mine that have

21

kids and in the invitation of my friends and

22

their kids, I'm sure I may have invited some

23

of my friend's kids to come.

24
25

Q.
yours.

Anybody that is not a friend of

 
Page 14

Any female under the age of 18, did
you invite them to come to Jeffrey's home?

4

MR. PAGLIUCA:

5

and foundation.

6

A.

Object to the form

Again, as I said, I am not aware of

7

inviting anybody other than friends of mine

8

who have children to the house.

9

Q.

Did you invite Virginia Giuffre to

10

come to Jeffrey Epstein's home when she was

11

under the age of 18?

12

MR. PAGLIUCA:

13

and foundation.

14

A.

Object to the form

Virginia Roberts held herself out

15

as a masseuse and invited herself to come and

16

give a massage.

17

Q.

My question is, did you invite

18

Virginia Roberts when she was under the age

19

of 18 to come to Jeffrey Epstein's home?

20

MR. PAGLIUCA:

21

and foundation.

22

A.

23

25

Object to the form

Again, Virginia Roberts was a

I'm asking not asking if she was a
I'm asking if you invited her to

 
Page 15
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

come to Jeffrey Epstein's home?

3

A.

Again, there would be no course to

4

have a conversation with Virginia unless she

5

held herself out to be a masseuse.

6

Q.

I'm not asking that question.

I'm

7

asking if you invited her to come to Jeffrey

8

Epstein's home when she was under the age of

9

18?

10

A.

Again, I repeat, she was a masseuse

11

and in the form and as my job, I was to have

12

people who he wanted for various things

13

including massage.

14
15

Q.

She came as a masseuse.

So you invited her to his home to

come to give a massage, is that correct?

Page 16

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

A.

Ms. Roberts held herself out --

3

Q.

I'm not asking how she held herself

4

out.

I'm asking how she arrived at the home.

5

Did you meet her and invite her to come to

6

the home or how did she arrive there?

7

MR. PAGLIUCA:

8

and foundation.

9

A.

Object to the form

Ms. Roberts held her to be a

10

masseuse and her mother drove her to the

11

house.

12
13

Q.
Roberts?

14
15

A.

Q.

Do you recall meeting her at

Mar-a-Lago?

18
19

I don't have a recollection of the

first meeting.

16
17

When did you first meet Virginia

A.

Like I said, I don't have a

recollection of meeting Ms. Roberts.

20

Q.

So you recall Ms. Roberts being

21

brought to the home by her mother, is that

22

your testimony?

23

A.

That is my testimony.

24

Q.

And that is the first time you met

25

her?

 
Page 17
1
2

G Maxwell - Confidential
A.

Like I said, I don't recall meeting

3

her the first time.

I do remember her mother

4

bringing her to the house.

5

Q.

Are you a member at Mar-a-Lago?

6

A.

No.

7

Q.

Have you visited Mar-a-Lago?

8

A.

Yes.

9

Q.

Did you visit Mar-a-Lago in the

10

year 2000?

11

A.

I'm pretty sure I did.

12

Q.

When Ms. Roberts arrived at the

13
14

home with her mother, what happened?
A.

I spoke to her mother outside of

15

the house and she -- what I don't recall is

16

exactly what happened because I was talking

17

to her mother the entire she was in the

18

house.

19
20

Q.

Did you introduce Ms. Roberts to

Jeffrey Epstein?

21

A.

22

Mr. Epstein.

23

mother the entire time outside the house.

24
25

Q.

I don't recall how she actually met
As I said, I spoke to her

Did you walk Ms. Roberts up to the

upstairs location at the Palm Beach house to

 
Page 18

G Maxwell - Confidential
meet Mr. Epstein?

3

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Object to the form

4

and foundation.

5

Q.

You can answer.

6

A.

I just explained.

7

A.

I spent the entire time talking to

8

Virginia's mother outside the house so the

9

answer to the question is no.

10
11

Q.

No, did you not walk her up and

introduce her to Mr. Epstein?

12

A.

I just said no.

13

Q.

Did you participate in a massage

14

this first time when she first came to the

15

home and you were speaking with her mother,

16

she was in the home, is that correct, you

17

brought her into the home?

18

MR. PAGLIUCA:

19

and foundation.

20

A.

Object to the form

I will repeat again, I was standing

21

outside with her mother so very difficult for

22

me to do anything else at that time so no, I

23

did not take her upstairs.

24

Q.

Did you participate --

25

A.

Virginia lied 100 percent about

 
Page 19
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

absolutely everything that took place in that

3

first meeting.

4

often and is just an awful fantasist.

5

very difficult for anything to take place

6

that she repeated because I was with her

7

mother the entire time.

8

Q.

She has lied repeatedly,
So

So did you have -- did you give a

9

massage with Virginia Roberts and Mr. Epstein

10

during the first time Virginia Roberts was at

11

the West Palm Beach house?

12

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Object to the form

13

and foundation.

14

Q.

Yes or no?

15

A.

No.

16

Q.

Have you ever given a massage with

17

Virginia Roberts in the room and Jeffrey

18

Epstein?

19

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Object to the form

20

and foundation.

21

A.

No.

22

Q.

Have you ever given Jeffrey Epstein

23
24
25

a massage?
MR. PAGLIUCA:
foundation.

Object to the form,

And I'm going to instruct

 
Page 20
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

you not to answer that question.

3

don't have any problem with you asking

4

questions about what the subject matter

5

of this lawsuit is, which would be, as

6

you've termed it, sexual trafficking of

7

Ms. Roberts.

8
9

I

To the extent you are asking for
information relating to any consensual

10

adult interaction between my client and

11

Mr. Epstein, I'm going to instruct her

12

not to answer because it's not part of

13

this litigation and it is her private

14

confidential information, not subject to

15

this deposition.

16

MS. McCAWLEY:

You can instruct her

17

not to answer.

18

I will bring her back for another

19

deposition because it is part of the

20

subject matter of this litigation so she

21

should be answering these questions.

22

This is civil litigation, deposition and

23

she should be responsible for answering

24

these questions.

25

That is your right.

MR. PAGLIUCA:

But

I disagree and you

 
Page 21
1
2

G Maxwell - Confidential
understand the bounds that I put on it.

3

MS. McCAWLEY:

No, I don't.

I will

4

continue to ask my questions and you can

5

continue to make your objections.

6

Q.

Did you ever participate from the

7

time period of 1992 to 2009, did you ever

8

participate in a massage with Jeffrey Epstein

9

and another female?

10

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Objection.

Do not

11

answer that question.

12

extent you are asking for some sort of

13

illegal activity as you've construed in

14

connection with this case I don't have

15

any problem with you asking that

16

question.

17

involve consensual acts between adults,

18

frankly, they're none of your business

19

and I will instruct the witness not to

20

answer.

21

Again, to the

To the extent these questions

MS. McCAWLEY:

This case involves

22

sexual trafficking, sexual abuse,

23

questions about her having interactions

24

with other females is relevant to this

25

case.

She needs to answer these

 
Page 22

G Maxwell - Confidential
questions.

3
4

MR. PAGLIUCA:

I'm instructing her

not to answer.

5

MS. McCAWLEY:

here again.

Q.

I will do that.

Have you ever observed a female

15

under the age of 18 at Jeffrey Epstein's home

16

that was not a friend, a child -- one of your

17

friend's children?

18

A.

Again, I can't testify to that

19

because I have no idea what you are talking

20

about.

21

Q.

You have no idea what I'm talking

22

about in the sense you never observed a

female under the age of 18 at Jeffrey

No, that's absolutely not true, on

13

the second part of your question, I have not

Will you read back the question.

A.

I believe I answered the later part

Object to the form

You need to straddle that question

in a different time period.

that gave Jeffrey, men and women who gave

Jeffrey massages were adults over the age of

Q.

No, it is not.

You can answer the question in full

but please provide yes or no as an initial

A.

I cannot answer yes or no, it's not

Q.

It's entirely possible I

How would I know when
There is no way I

Did you stay at Jeffrey Epstein's

home when you were in Palm Beach?

18

A.

Most of the time.

19

Q.

So how is it that you wouldn't know

20

if there was a female in the home under the

21

age of 18 if you were staying there?

22

A.

Well, first of all, when I was

23

staying there, the house is actually quite

24

large and I have a very busy job and I had an

25

office with a door so the door would be shut

 
Page 29

and I would be working.

for what Jeffrey does and I don't always pay

attention to what happens in the house.

Q.

I'm not responsible

So you're testifying that you never

observed a female under the age of 18 at

Jeffrey Epstein's West Palm Beach home?

11

A.

I'm

I already answered that question, I

believe.

Q.

You didn't answer my question.

A.

I did.

15

Q.

Did you observe a female under the

16

age of 18 at Jeffrey Epstein's home in Palm

17

Beach?

18

A.

Like I said, I work, I don't sit

19

there and watch people coming in and out of

20

the house.

21

in the home that somebody was there that I

22

did not see, I cannot comment on it, I have

23

no idea.

24
25

Q.

I cannot possibly tell you if I'm

Did you observe females at Jeffrey

Epstein's home that were laying out topless

 
Page 30

G Maxwell - Confidential

in the back of the home, in other words

3

without a shirt on?

4

A.

So that's just another of

5

Virginia's lies.

6

time when I was there and present, frequently

7

at the house, it was unusual to see people

8

without their clothes on.

9

Q.

So let's be clear, at the

When you say unusual, did you

10

observe people without their clothes at

11

Jeffrey Espstein's home?

12

A.

Can I answer.

Sometimes people in

14

have seen people from time to time take their

15

top off.

16

17

around the people at any frequent period of

18

time, I have never seen.

I have seen people from time to
Very unusual.

Naked people

19

Q.

Were they under the age of 18?

20

A.

As I was saying, people when I was

21

in the house, were of adult age, if they were

22

children, friends of my family or friends

23

that were there, they may well have been

24

because I have nieces and nephews under the

25

age of 18, I cannot testify to anybody else

 
Page 31

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

-- just another one of Virginia's many

3

fictitious lies and stories to make this a

4

salacious event to get interest and press.

5

It's absolute rubbish.

6

Q.

Were you in charge of hiring

7

individuals to provide massages for Jeffrey

8

Epstein?

9

A.

My job included hiring many people.

10

There were six homes.

11

assistants, I hired architects, I hired

12

decorators, I hired cooks, I hired cleaners,

13

I hired gardeners, I hired pool people, I

14

hired pilots, I hired all sorts of people.

15

As I sit here, I hired

In the course and a very small part

16

of my job was from from time to time to find

17

adult professional massage therapists for

18

Jeffrey.

19

Q.

When you say adult professional

20

massage therapists, where did you find these

21

massage therapists?

22

A.

From time to time I would visit

23

professional spas, I would receive a massage

24

and if the massage was good I would ask that

25

man or woman if they did home visits.

3

Q.

Did you ever hire a masseuse that

was under the age of 18?

4

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Object to the form

5

and foundation.

6

Q.

Did you?

7

A.

Again, I don't hire massage

8

therapists, so that was not my job.

9

Q.

You just said you did, you just

10

said you hired massage therapists for Jeffrey

11

Epstein, I'm asking if you hired a massage

12

therapist who was under the age of 18?

13

A.

Let me correct myself.

When I

14

meant hire, I didn't mean hire in the way you

15

are doing it.

16

spas and I met people and if they did home

17

visits, Jeffrey would then, in fact, hire

18

them.

19

someone.

20

it's not a correct characterization.

21

What I say is that I went to

I'm not responsible for hiring

Q.

And they were not full-time, so

Did you ever, your term is meet,

did you ever meet a person that was under the

as a masseuse?

and foundation.

3

A.

First of all, Virginia Roberts who

4

you are referring to was a masseuse aged 17,

5

we all now know, so your story that you keep

6

pushing out to the press that she was a 15

7

year old -- you and I both know was a lie,

8

correct.

9

Q.

You are not sentencing my question.

10

A.

You and I both know that was a lie,

11
12

correct.
Q.

You are not answering my question.

13

I'm asking you whether you ever met a female

14

under the age of 18 that Jeffrey then hired

15

as a masseuse?

16

MR. PAGLIUCA:

17

and foundation.

18

A.

Object to the form

The only person I can talk about

19

who clearly was a massage age 17, a masseuse,

was Virginia.

Q.

Did you meet her and then introduce

her to Jeffrey?
A.

I don't know.

I already testified

I don't recall meeting her.

MR. PAGLIUCA:

I got it.

9

Q.

Is that a statement that you wrote?

10

A.

It appears to be.

11

Q.

So does that correct your testimony

12
13
14

that you did meet Ms. Roberts at Mar-a-Lago?
A.

Again, this was written in, when

were you saying?

15

Q.

2011.

16

A.

So by 2011, Ms. Roberts had already

17

perpetrated so many lies and stories it's

18

hard for me to accurately tell you today what

19

I remember back then.

20

the testimony I give you today, I do not

21

recollect it.

22
23
24
25

Q.

As I sit here today,

Do you have a reason to say that

this document that you wrote is incorrect?
A.

It's in 2011, I can't possibly tell

you what I remember in 2011.

Q.

Are you questioning that this

3

document is incorrect, this document -- this

4

email that you wrote?

5

A.

I wrote an email.

I was trying to

6

be accurate, so who knows, with all the

7

rubbish that you guys have put out in the

8

press that I read, maybe in the moment I

9

wrote it a memory came to me that I don't

10

know, but as I sit here today and the

11

testimony I gave you today is I don't

12

recollect it.

13

Q.

Does this refresh your recollection

14

that you recalled meeting Ms. Roberts at

15

Mar-a-Lago?

16

A.

It does not.

17

Q.

So your testimony today is that you

18

don't remember meeting Ms. Roberts at

19

Mar-a-Lago?

20
21

A.

I do not.
I just want to clarify, when you

22

read so much stuff and so much rubbish that

23

comes out from Virginia Roberts, you don't

24

know what's up and down, at the time I wrote

this I believe I had a memory but as I sit

3

asking if you are aware that there were over

4

30 underage girls who gave reports to police

5

officers during the time you worked for

6

Jeffrey Epstein.

7

Are you aware of that?

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Counsel, what is

8

your factual basis for asserting there

9

are 30 underaged people who gave

10
11
12
13

reports?
MS. McCAWLEY:

I don't have to

answer that.
MR. PAGLIUCA:

Are you representing

14

as an officer of the court that you have

15

personal knowledge that there are 30

16

people referenced in these police

17

reports?

18
19
20

MS. McCAWLEY:

That's my

understanding, that there are 30 girls.
MR. PAGLIUCA:

How is that your

21

understanding if these are redacted

22

reports?

23
24
25

MS. McCAWLEY:

By reading through

the reports.
MR. PAGLIUCA:

So you have personal

 
Page 89

G Maxwell - Confidential
knowledge there are 30 people --

3

MS. McCAWLEY:

Just like can you if

4

you read through -- I will not argue

5

with you counsel.. she can answer yes or

6

no.

7

Q.

Are you aware there were over 30

8

individuals who were minors who gave reports

9

to police just like the one we just read that

10

they were sexually assaulted by Jeffrey

11

Epstein in the Palm Beach home during the

12

years that you were working with him?

13

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Objection to the

14

form and foundation.

15

you have knowledge.

16

A.

You can answer if

I already testified I was limited

17

in the house, a couple of days, there is no

18

way I knew.

19

cannot testify to 30.

20

I've had with Virginia's lies, it's very hard

21

for me to testify about what I see.

22

tell from you my personal knowledge I did not

23

know what you are referring to.

24
25

Q.

I have read these reports.

I

Given the experience

I can

You did not know there were

underage girls in the home that were being

 
Page 90
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein during the time

3

you were working there?

4
5

A.

Based on the lies that I have

already been told, I cannot comment on any --

6

Q.

Are you saying these 30 girls are

7

lying when they gave these reports to police

8

officers?

9
10

A.

I'm testifying to Virginia's lies.

11
12

I'm not testifying to their lies.

Q.

I am not asking about Virginia's

lies.

13

A.

I can only testify to Virginia's

14

lies.

15

reports.

16

about them.

17

I can testify to having read these

Q.

I cannot testify to anything else

So your testimony is that during

18

the time you were working there, you did not

19

know that these minor children were being

20

abused in the home while you were there?

21

A.

What I have already told you and I

22

will repeat, I was in the house very limited

23

times, very few times.

24

you are referring to.

25

reports but based on the lies that Virginia

I do not know what
I've read these

 
Page 91
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

has perpetrated, cannot tell you what is true

3

or factual or not.

4

Q.

You said you were in the home a

5

very limited time, so average in the year for

6

example, 2004, how many times would you have

7

been in his Palm Beach home?

8

A.

9

little.

10

Q.

How about his New York home?

11

A.

Same.

12

Q.

Were you his girlfriend in that

13

Very hard for me to state but very

year, in 2004?

14

A.

Define what you mean by girlfriend.

15

Q.

Were you in a relationship with him

16

where you would consider yourself his

17

girlfriend?

18

A.

No.

19

Q.

Did you ever consider yourself his

20
21

girlfriend?
A.

That's a tricky question.

There

22

were times when I would have liked to think

23

of myself as his girlfriend.

24

Q.

When would that have been?

25

A.

Probably in the early '90s.

 
Page 92

2

Q.

In your responsibilities in working

3

for Jeffrey, would you book massages for him

4

on any given day so that he would have a

5

massage scheduled?

6

example and book a massage for him?

7

Would you take a call for

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Objection to the

8

form and foundation.

9

Q.

You can answer.

10

A.

Typically, that was not my

11

responsibility.

12

massage himself or one of his other

13

assistants would do that.

14
15

Q.

He would either book the

From time to time you had to do

that?

16

MR. PAGLIUCA:

17

form and foundation.

18

A.

Objection to the

19
20

Like I said, typically it was

somebody else's responsibility.
Q.

If you were unable to book a girl

21

for a massage on a given day, would that mean

22

that you were responsible for giving him a

23

sexual massage?

24
25

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Objection to the

form and foundation and I instruct you

 
Page 93
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

not to answer any questions about any of

3

your consensual adult sexual activity.

4

Q.

5

So you are not going to answer that

question?

6

A.

You just heard my counsel.

7

Q.

Have you ever said to anybody that

8

recruiting other girls to perform sexual

9

massages for Jeffrey Epstein takes the

10

pressure off you?

11

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Object to the form

12

and foundation.

13

A.

Repeat the question and break it

Q.

Have you ever said to anybody that

14

out.

15
16

you recruit girls --

17

A.

Stop right there.

I never

18

recruited girls, let's stop there.

19

breakdown the question.

Now

20

Q.

Have you ever said to anybody --

21

A.

By girls, we are talking about

22

underage people -- you said girls, are you

23

talking about underage -- we are not talking

24

about consensual acts -- this is a defamation

25

suit.

 
Page 94

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

Q.

I'm asking the questions.

I know

3

what this case is about.

I'm trying to -- I

4

will ask you questions if you don't

5

understand the question I can break it down

6

for you.

I'm happy to do that.

7

A.

Break it down a lot please.

8

Q.

I will do that.

9
10

The question is, have you ever said
to anybody that you recruit other girls --

11

A.

Why don't you stop there.

12

Q.

Let me finish my question.

13

Have you ever said to anybody that

14

you recruit girls to take the pressure off

15

you, so you won't have to have sex with

16

Jeffrey, have you said that?

17

That's the question?

18

A.

You don't ask me questions like

19

that.

First of all, you are trying to trap

20

me, I will not be trapped.

21

if I recruit, I told you no.

22

underage, I already said I don't do that with

23

underage people and as to ask me about a

24

specific conversation I had with language, we

25

talking about almost 17 years ago when this

You are asking me
Girls meaning

3

conversation or language that I used with

4

anybody at any time.

5

Q.

I cannot testify to an actual

Have you ever said to anybody that

6

you recruit other females over the age of 18

7

to take the pressure off you to having to

8

have sex with Jeffrey?

9

A.

I totally resent and find it

10

disgusting that you use the word recruit.

11

already told you I don't know what you are

12

saying about that and your implication is

13

repulsive.

I

14

Q.

Answer my question.

15

A.

I just did.

16

Q.

Have you ever said to anybody that

17

you recruit females --

18

A.

I don't recruit anybody.

19

Q.

That's an answer.

20
21
22

So you never

said that?
A.

I'm testifying that I cannot

testify to an actual language --

23

Q.

It's a yes or no.

24

A.

I will not testify to an actual

25

statement made 17 years ago, so I cannot

 
Page 96

3

G Maxwell - Confidential
testify to actual language.
Q.

So you won't testify to anything

4

I'm asking you 17 years ago about a statement

5

you made.

How do you know it's 17 years ago?

6

A.

We are talking about a time in

7

2000, right?

8

Q.

Have you ever said that to anybody?

9

A.

I'm 54 years old so you are asking

10

me in my entire life, what words are you

11

asking me in my entire life?

12

Q.

Your entire life is limited by the

13

time you were with Jeffrey, this is the

14

question.

15
16
17

A.

Let's time limit the question you

are asking me.
Q.

So from, let's say, I think you

18

said you started with him in 1992, is that

19

correct, and finished with him in 2009.

20

So from 1992 to 2009 have you ever

21

said to anybody that you recruit other and we

22

will start with girls to take the pressure

23

off you to have sex with Jeffrey?

24

MR. PAGLIUCA:

form and foundation.

Objection to the

A.

First of all I resent and despise

3

the world recruit.

4

what you mean by recruit and by girls, you

5

mean underage people.

6

anything with underage people.

7

you reask the question in a way that I am

8

able to answer it.

9

Q.

Would you like to define

I never had to do
So why don't

I'm asking if you ever said that to

10

anybody.

11

recruit and you never used that word then the

12

answer to that question would be no.

13
14
15

A.

So if you don't understand the word

I have no memory as I sit here

today having used that word.
Q.

Did you ever meet an underage girl

16

in London to introduce her to Jeffrey to

17

provide him with a massage?

18

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Objection to the

20

A.

Run that past me one more time.

Are you asking me if any foreigner,

not an American person, gave Jeffrey a

massage?

5

Q.

Yes.

6

A.

Well, as I sit here today, I can't

7

think of anyone who is foreign.

8

I just can't think of anybody right this

second.

10

Q.

12
13
14

Certainly --

How about any foreign girls who

were under the age of 18?
A.

I already testified to not knowing

anything about underage girls.

A.

Massage is for health benefits.

3

Q.

When did you first meet Jeffrey?

4

A.

Some point in 1991.

5

Q.

And did Jeffrey know your father?

6

A.

No.

7

Q.

How were you introduced to Jeffrey?

8

A.

Some friend introduced us.

9

Q.

Can you describe your relationship

10

back in 1991, was it friendship or was it

11

girlfriend relationship or was it a work

12

relationship, what was your relationship in

13

1991?

14

A.

It was just friendly.

15

16

began working for him in 1992, is that

17

correct?

18

A.

Yes.

19

Q.

In 1992 I know you gave me the

20

description of the work that you were

performing for him, how much was he paying

you, do you remember?

A.

I don't recall.

much he was paying you?

I don't recall.

3

Q.

Did it change over the years or did

the payment remain the same?

I believe over the course of time

it increased a little bit.
Q.

Was that the -- was that payment

8

the payment that -- was the payment made with

9

respect to the jobs, the work you were

10

performing for Jeffrey, was that your sole

income at that time?

MR. PAGLIUCA:

I object to the

13

form.

14

not to answer about sources of -- your

15

personal sources of income outside of

16

Mr. Epstein at all.

17

I'm also going to instruct you

18
19

21

MS. McCAWLEY:

What's the basis for

that?
MR. PAGLIUCA:

It's confidential,

it's not part of this lawsuit.
MS. McCAWLEY:

We have a protective

22

order and it is part of this lawsuit

23

with respect to our damage claims.

24
25

MR. PAGLIUCA:

It's not and, in

fact, you are not entitled to ask

 
Page 103
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

financial information of a defendant in

3

this kind of case, in a defamation case

4

unless and until there is a finding that

5

you are entitled to punitive damages.

6

That is clear in New York case law, both

7

state and Federal.

8

MS. McCAWLEY:

9
10

We disagree on that

point and we will come back to that.
Q.

From the source of payment from the

11

source of Jeffrey, from your work, can you

12

give me a range on that, do you know was it

13

over $100,000?

14

A.

I just testified I don't recall.

15

Q.

You don't don't know if it was

16

$500,000?

17

A.

It was less than that.

18

Q.

Somewhere between 100 and 500,

19
20
21
22

would that be fair to say?
A.

I believe it was between 100 and

$200,000.
Q.

Did Jeffrey during the time that

23

you were working for him purchase a town home

24

for you?

A.

The subject of the townhouse is, I

Q.

So a loan through Jeffrey?

Did he purchase for you a

It was his helicopter.

Q.

When did you obtain your pilot

Q.

Was that for both airplanes and

Q.

Would that have been in 2002?

A.

It's very hard for me to recollect

11
12
13
14

exact dates but that sounds about right.
Q.

Was that during the time that

Virginia was working for Jeffrey?
A.

I don't know that Virginia ever did

15

work for Jeffrey.

16

she testified to her so-called duties, we

17

know she is a serial liar so I can't testify

18

to what she did or didn't do.

11

exactly when I flew with him.

I don't recall

I do.

Q.

How long have you known him?

21

really a long time ago.

Do you remember how you first met

No, I do not.

2

A.

That would be another of Virginia's

lies and the lies you perpetrate.

at any time ever, so just add that the to

6

long list of lies.

A.

Clearly he knew him.

9

I never

I think we

have that answer but how -- yeah.

10

Q.

Do you know how Jeffery met

A.

I do not know Jeffrey met

11

What I do know is that I did not

14

introduce them.

16

That is one of the many

Are we tallying all the lies?

I do not know when Jeffrey met

Q.

Did you ever introduce

to any girls under the age of 18 who
were not friends of yours children?

that he may have met socially through me.
Q.

4
5

Did you ever introduce

to Virginia in London?
A.

I understand her story about

6

but again, her tissue of lies is extremely

7

hard to pick apart what is true and what

8

isn't.

9

all but for her tissue stories about this

10
11
12

Actually I wouldn't recollect her at

situation.
Q.

So did you ever introduce

to Virginia in London?

13

A.

I have no recollection.

14

Q.

Did Virginia ever stay at your home

15
16

in London, your town home?
A.

I know she claims she did but if

17

you are asking me here today to remember

18

specifically, I cannot.

19

Q.

Do you remember taking a trip with

THE VIDEOGRAPHER:

Q.

Ms. Maxwell, I think I handed you

right before the break, did I hand you the

9

flight logs, they look like this.

10

Did I mark

those yet, I thought I did.

11

A.

I don't believe I have it.

12

Q.

These admittedly are a little

13

difficult to read so what I'm going to

14

provide you with to assist is I have a chart

15

that has the airport codes, because it will

16

have, for example, just for the record

17

reflects that the first page of document

18

, it will have a code in the from line

19

that says PBI, for example, to TEB so I a

20

chart that matches up, just in case you don't

21

understand what those letters mean, PBI

22

meaning Palm Beach, TEB meaning Teterboro,

23

which is New Jersey, but others are more

24

difficult but just for you to be able to

25

understand the logs, I will provide you with

 
Page 119

that.

3

MR. PAGLIUCA:

So we are clear, if

4

the witness has personal knowledge of

5

what these are that's fine but I don't

6

know what these are and I don't expect

7

the witness to accept the representation

8

that they are what they are.

9

MS. McCAWLEY:

If she can testify

10

to what city it is, she can state that

11

on the record.

12

MR. PAGLIUCA:

If she knows what it

13

is, she knows what it is, we are not

14

putting any affirmatively on the record

15

until you ask your questions.

16

Q.

So I'm going to ask you and I think

17

we flagged a few of the pages which may

18

direct us a little bit easier but I will do

19

it by Bates number which is at the bottom of

20

the document kind of at the side.

22

The first I will direct your
attention to is

Q.

Do you recall flying with Jeffrey

10

Epstein on his plane over 300 times during

11

the period of 1999 to 2005?

12

A.

impossible.

I already testified I was on his

A.

I cannot testify to that.

I'm just

saying it may not be me.

19

Q.

I'm asking the questions.

20

A.

I'm not being difficult.

I'm just

asking, it's like 14, 15 years ago, it's

you want.

11

Q.

So pick any pages

Does that refresh your recollection

12

at all as to whether GM represents you or

13

some other individual?

14

A.

Again, I can't testify whether that

15

represents me or not, I don't see any other

16

GMs but you have to understand that even if

17

my name is on that record doesn't mean I was

18

on the flight.

19

Q.

So are you contesting the accuracy

20

of the flight logs?

21

it doesn't represent you are on the flight so

22

is it your testimony just because a name is

23

listed doesn't mean they were actually on the

Q.

Would it be fair to say that

President Clinton and Jeffrey are friends?
A.

I wouldn't be able to characterize

it like that, no.

18

Q.

Are they acquaintances?

I wouldn't categorize it.

He just allowed him to use his

Objection to the

I don't recall the trip at all and

this looks like a total work trip, not a

party trip.

Q.

What would be the difference

between a work trip and a party trip?
A.

Just that I would be on trips for

17

work and I believe that this looks like,

18

looks like it's one of the -- probably one of

19

the designers and the time would meet with a

20

trip to decorate the house, just the timing

21

of it.

22

Q.

So would Virginia be brought on

23

trips that were for the purpose of work and

24

decorating the house?

25

A.

Like I said, I never worked with

 
Page 147

her but you would have to ask Jeffrey what he

3

brought her on the trip for.

4
5

Q.

But she would travel with him when

there was a work trip like this?

6

A.

I can't -- I'm seeing that she is

7

on this flight but I have no idea what she is

8

doing, he invited her, it would not be my

job.

Your recollection is -- what is

your recollection, do you recollect Nadia

17

traveling often on flights with Jeffrey?

A.

Absolutely not.

No, not at all.

I

don't recollect her actually on the flight at

all.

I also just want to say that at

parties.

Q.

Jeffrey went for work so -- was

The flight we were looking at, yes

but it was to Santa Fe -A.

I don't recall going to any parties

16

in Santa Fe at any time but certainly flying

17

to Santa Fe for a party seems highly

18

improbable.

19

Q.

So I'm going to direct your

20

attention to the document that I set before

21

you which is Bates number

22

has different Bates numbers because it's a

23

smaller version of the larger production.

24

These are the pages I will be asking about.

25

In the time that you were working

and it

 
Page 149

with Jeffrey in Palm Beach, do you recall a

3

process for taking, anybody at the house

4

taking messages when incoming phone calls

5

came in?

6

A.

You are supposed to take a message

7

and receive the message and write the message

8

down.

9

it was taken and who took it and what the

10
11

Who was the message was for, what time

message was, obviously.
Q.

Does what's in front of you look

12

familiar with respect to the message pads

13

that you would have used at the house?

14

A.

It is familiar.

15

Q.

I'm going to direct your attention

16
17

to the second page of it?
MR. PAGLIUCA:

These all have SAO

18

numbers on them or Bates ranges and I

19

don't see any of your Bates ranges on

A.

I did not know that.

A.

I can only testify to what I know.

12

I know that Virginia is a liar and I know

13

what she testified is a lie.

14

testify to what I know to be a falsehood and

15

half those falsehoods are enormous and so I

16

can only categorically deny everything she

17

has said and that is the only thing I can

18

talk about because I have no knowledge of

19

anything else.

Q.

So I can only

Do you believe Jeffrey Epstein

A.

Again, I repeat, Virginia is a liar

I'm asking about

Again, I just repeat, I can only

go -- my belief is Virginia is a liar.

Q.

What is that belief?

A.

She is an absolute liar and

everything that stems from that is a lie.

A.

Take her

It's my question.

We are here today because of

12

Virginia and her lies because this is a

13

defamation suit.

14

Q.

Setting aside Virginia, do you

15

believe Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused

16

minors?

17

A.

I cannot set aside Virginia because

18

that's why we are here and this is the only

19

reason I am sitting here in this room and I

20

will not set her aside and I cannot comment

21

about anything else except her because she is

22

the only person I actually know about.

Q.

Are you refusing to answer that

question?
A.

I am not refusing the question.

absolute total liar and you all know she is.

She lied about her age, you know she lied

MR. PAGLIUCA:

I object to the form

5

and you made your record, she answered

the question.

7

answer is she doesn't have a belief

8

because she doesn't have any personal

9

knowledge.

10

A fair reading of her

A.

Let her

It's a fair answer

Again, I testified my only personal

knowledge concerns Virginia and everything

17

Virginia has said is an absolute lie, which

18

is why we are here in this room.

19

asking me to testify about things I have no

20

knowledge of other than the police report

21

that you showed me, I am not in a position to

22

make a statement based on that because you

are asking me to speculate and I cannot

question, have at it.

17

Q.

If you want to mark it and

Okay.

Ms. Maxwell, is it your belief that

18

Jeffrey Epstein interacted sexually with

19

minors?

20

A.

Again, you are asking me the same

21

type of question exactly but with different

22

language.

23

somebody who claims these things that I have

24

personal knowledge of is Virginia.

25

is an absolute liar and everything she has

Again, my only knowledge of

Virginia

 
Page 180
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

said is a lie.

3

lies I cannot speculate on what anybody else

4

did or didn't do because if Virginia is the

5

example of what that story is and everything

6

she said is false, so everything that leads

7

from that is false.

8
9

Q.

Therefore, based on those

So the 30 other minor children in

the police report are also telling lies about

10

being sexually abused during massages with

11

Mr. Epstein?

30 minors are?

MS. McCAWLEY:

Counsel, can you

I'm asking my

question.
MR. PAGLIUCA:

You are making a

19

representation about numbers, you are

20

making a representation on the record

21

about what people said or didn't say.

22

We have no knowledge about that.

23

are all redacted records so these are

24

bad questions.

25

admissible evidence.

These

They don't lead to any
It is only being

propounded to the witness to harass her.

3

So we are done with these questions.

4

MS. McCAWLEY: Are you done?

5

MR. PAGLIUCA:

6

Q.

Yes.

My question is, are you aware that

7

Jeffrey Epstein was convicted of having

8

relations with a minor child?

9
10

MR. PAGLIUCA:
question already.

11
12

She answered that

MS. McCAWLEY:

I'm getting to my

next question.

13

MR. PAGLIUCA:

14

question.

15

question.

16

Ask your next

Don't keep asking the same

MS. McCAWLEY:

You are now

17

shouting, I want the record to reflect

18

that you are interrupting the

19

deposition.

20

take a deep breath and please let me ask

21

my questions.

22

I ask you to calm down,

MR. PAGLIUCA:

23

inappropriate.

24

Q.

25

Your behavior is

I will ask you again.
Do you believe that Jeffrey Epstein

 
Page 182
1
2

G Maxwell - Confidential
interacted sexually with minors?

3

A.

Again, I go back to this, my only

4

actual knowledge is with Virginia and

5

Virginia is a liar, so I can only talk to

6

what Virginia's story and as I said before

7

and there are so many examples, I mean

8

thousands of examples of her lies, that that

9

is the only thing I can talk to.

10
11

Q.

that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused minors?

12
13

A.

Again, as I said, I'm only talking

to what I know, I can only talk to Virginia.

14
15

Based on that you do not believe

Q.

So is it your belief that Jeffrey

Epstein did not sexually abuse minors?

16

A.

Again, I can only talk to what I

17

know and I know that Virginia is a liar and

18

that what she said is a lie.

19

testify to what she accused and you guys put

20

in the press for salacious purposes and

21

whatever terrible, inappropriate, unethical

22

and terrible reasons you chose to do that

23

about me and I can testify those are all

24

lies.

25

Q.

So I can only

Do you know whether Jeffrey Epstein

 
Page 183
1
2

G Maxwell - Confidential
sexually abused any minor children?

3

A.

Again, I only know 1000 percent

4

that Virginia is a liar.

5

Virginia, her lies and your inappropriate,

6

unethical, really unattractive, terrible use

7

of her and the way that you have abused the

8

system, used the press for purposes that are

9

unethical, inappropriate and appalling.

10

Q.

I can only talk to

Do you believe that Jeffrey Epstein

11

used massages to lure minors to have sex with

12

him?

13
14

A.

Again, that is Virginia's

testimony, which is a lie.

15

Q.

But do you believe that?

16

A.

Again, I refer back to Virginia.

17

Q.

I'm asking whether you believe it

18

or not?

19

A.

I can only go with what I know and

20

I know Virginia is a liar and therefore

21

that's a lie.

22

Q.

So you don't believe that?

23

A.

I said, I only know that Virginia

24
25

is lying.
Q.

Are you aware that Jeffrey Epstein

 
Page 184

2

is a registered sex offender?

3

A.

I am.

4

Q.

Are you aware that Jeffrey Epstein

5

paid considerable amounts of money to settle

6

lawsuits with the minor children that he had

7

sexual contact with?

9

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Objection to the

10

A.

11

issues.

12

Q.

I have no knowledge of those

Why did you continue to maintain

13

contact with Jeffrey Epstein after he pled

14

guilty?

15

A.

I'm a very loyal person and Jeffrey

16

was very good to me when my father passed

17

away and I believe that you need to be a good

18

friend in people's hour of need and I felt

19

that it was a very thoughtful, nice thing for

20

me to do to help in very limited fashion

21

which was helping if he had any issue with

22

his homes, in terms of the staffing issues.

23

It was very, very minor but I felt it was

24

thoughtful in somebody's hour of need.

25

Q.

Did he continue to pay you during

 
Page 185
1
2

G Maxwell - Confidential
that time period?

3

A.

I was paid a little.

4

Q.

You were paid?

5

A.

Yes.

6

Q.

When you say a little, what you did

7

mean by that?

8

A.

I don't recall exactly the amount.

9

Q.

So in 2009 when you left him, what

10

were you being paid?

11

A.

I just told you, I don't recall.

12

Q.

Were you being paid $100,000?

13

A.

I just don't you I don't recall.

14

Q.

Were you paid over a million

15
16
17

dollars?
A.

I think I would remember over a

million dollars.

18

Q.

So it was under a million dollars?

19

A.

It was under a million dollars.

20

Q.

Was it over $500,000?

21

A.

I just told you, it was under 500,

22

it was an amount of money less than $500,000,

23

less than a million dollars and I did it out

24

of thoughtfulness and consideration for

25

somebody who was in trouble.

 
Page 186

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

Q.

Did you have an attorney to consult

3

with during the criminal investigation of

4

Jeffrey Epstein?

5

A.

I don't believe I did.

6

Q.

When did you learn that a search

7

warrant was executed for the Palm Beach

8

house?

9

A.

I don't recall exactly.

10

Q.

Were you present at the house in

11

advance of the search warrant being executed?

12

MR. PAGLIUCA:

13

of the question.

14

A.

Object to the form

I don't remember when the search

15

warrant was executed and I don't remember the

16

year that the search warrant was executed and

17

whenever that was, I already testified, I was

18

very, very infrequently at the house.

19

highly unlikely but I was there a couple of

20

days, I just don't know which days it was in

21

relation to the police situation.

22

Q.

So

Did you have a computer at the Palm

23

Beach home that was a computer that you would

24

use?

25

A.

No.

 
Page 187

3

Q.

Was there a computer available for

use in the Palm Beach house?

4

A.

Can you be more specific.

5

Q.

Was there anywhere in the Palm

6

Beach house where there was a computer where

7

you said you worked for him and there were

8

other staff in the house, was there ever a

9

computer in the Palm Beach mansion that was

10

accessible by you or other staff?

11

MR. PAGLIUCA:

12

form and foundation.

13

A.

Objection to the

I stopped being regularly at the

14

house sometime in 2003 so from 2003 to when

15

the police search was executed, I have no

16

memory of what there was or what there was

17

not.

18

when I was present largely.

19

I can only testify for what was there

Q.

So in 2003 when you were still

20

there, was there a computer that was

21

accessible to you or other staff at the

22

house?

23

MR. PAGLIUCA:

24

form and foundation.

25

A.

Objection to the

There was a desktop computer that

 
Page 188

people could use -- just like you would use

3

if you needed to go online to get something,

4

that people could use.

5

Q.

Was that on a desk that you would

6

use in your work capacity when you were at

7

the house?

8
9
10

A.

It was a desk, it was a room I was,

I didn't really use that computer.
Q.

Were there images of naked girls

11

whether they be under the age of 18 or over

12

the age of 18 on that computer?

13

A.

I have no recollection of any naked

14

people on that computer when I was there in

15

2003, we are talking.

16

Q.

What about from say '99 to 2003?

17

A.

No, I can't recollect any naked

18
19

pictures.
Q.

Why were the computers removed from

the house before the search warrant was

executed?

now?

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Objection to the

6

A.

I don't know what computers you are

7

talking of and I have no idea what you are

8

referencing.

9

Q.

10

In 2003 you said there was a

computer in a room on a desk?

11

A.

Right.

12

Q.

Do you know where that computer is

14

A.

I do not.

15

Q.

Did you take pictures of nude

13

now?

16

females in any of Epstein's homes or in and

17

around the homes, out by the pool or anywhere

18

like, in the Palm Beach home, the New York

19

home, USVI home or the New Mexico home?

20

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Objection to the

21

form and foundation.

22

A.

Can you repeat the question.

23

Q.

Did you take pictures of nude woman

24

over 18 or under 18, females, in any of

25

Jeffrey Epstein's homes, inside or outside in

 
Page 190
1
2

G Maxwell - Confidential
or around the home?

3

A.

I think we need to distinguish

4

between anyone under the age of 18 and over

5

the age of 18.

6

Q.

We will start with, did you take

7

pictures of nude females in or around any of

8

Jeffrey's homes of women or females that were

9

under the age of 18?

10

A.

No.

11

Q.

Did you take pictures of nude

12

females --

13

A.

Nude you mean with no clothing on.

14

Q.

Or half nude, with no top on, any

15

sort of nakedness to an individual.

16

In any of Jeffrey's homes, either

17

Palm Beach, New Mexico, USVI or New York

18

either outside by the pool, anywhere in or

19

around those homes of females over the age of

20

18?

21

A.

So it is possible that I took

22

pictures of people that were somehow semi or

23

had some clothing on or no clothes on but at

24

no time were any of these pictures remotely

25

inappropriate.

They were, you could see them

 
Page 191
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

in a mainstream magazine today, there would

3

be no inappropriateness, they would be

4

covered, concealed, you wouldn't see anything

5

at all.

6

The types of -- first, I took very

7

few and they were always by request, this was

8

a picture you could put on your -- gift to

9

your parent or to your grandparents to put on

10

their mantel piece . It would be a very

11

benign sort of attractive picture where you

12

wouldn't see anything.

13

Q.

Who would request those pictures?

14

A.

From time to time, people, men and

15

women would ask to have nice photographs of

16

them taken.

17
18
19
20
21
22
23

Q.

And did Jeffrey Epstein request

those pictures?
A.

I don't ever recall him asking me

to take pictures.
Q.

Did you give him pictures of naked

females as a present?
A.

I don't recall ever giving a

24

present of -- I don't know why a photograph

25

would constitute a gift.

 
Page 192

2

G Maxwell - Confidential
Q.

Not as a gift.

3

Do you recall ever giving Jeffrey

4

Epstein pictures that you've taken of these

5

individuals in a naked state?

Objection to the

First of all, we've already

established that they are not naked state

10

photographs.

11

Q.

12
13

A piece of them being naked as you

described.
A.

I said they would be attractive as

14

you would see in mainstream magazines and

15

those pictures could be a picture of a hand

16

or a foot, they didn't necessarily

17

constitute -- I know where you are headed

18

with this and it's nowhere appropriate and

19

it's really unattractive.

20

Q.

I'm not headed anywhere.

I'm just

21

asking the questions.

22

Epstein any of these pictures that you took

23

of females in the state that you described?

24
25

A.

Did you give Jeffrey

I can't recall ever giving him

pictures but it is possible that I took

 
Page 193

2

pictures of people that would end up -- or a

3

friend of his that he would have -- not naked

4

or not inappropriate in any way, that he

5

might have somewhere in his house.

6
7

Q.

Name for me all the individuals who

you took these pictures of?

8

A.

It's entirely impossible for me to

Did you take a picture of Virginia

Roberts on her own without another individual

in it in a naked state?

6

A.

I don't recall ever taking a

7

picture of Virginia -- naked, we are not

referring to someone with no clothing on at

all, we are referring to someone that could

10

be semi clad or could have a towel or we are

not referring to anything inappropriate.

Q.

pictures of the type that you are describing?

15

Was this a hobby of yours to take

MR. PAGLIUCA:
A.

Object to the form.

I just testified, I didn't take

16

pictures of many people.

My preference is

17

pictures for landscapes and for architectural

18

pieces.

19

Q.

Where are those pictures today?

20

A.

I have no idea.

Q.

Do you have them in your home?

2

about the allegations related to the criminal

3

investigation that he was involved in?

4

A.

I really can't say, not because I

5

don't want to say but I just think of what he

6

has said to me over the course of this time.

7
8

Q.

explain what the charges were against him?

9
10

A.

I never had a detailed conversation

with him, as I recall.

11
12

Did he explain it to you and

Q.

Not detailed, just did he explain

anything that was happening to him?

13

A.

I haven't spoken to him for so

14

long.

15

conversations I had with him over the course

16

of time.

17

I can't possibly testify to what

Did he talk to you about any of the

girls that were making allegations against

19

him other than Virginia?

A.

about those things.
Q.

What has Jeffrey Epstein told you

about Virginia Roberts?

5

A.

That she is a liar.

6

Q.

What does he base that on?

MR. PAGLIUCA:

9

A.

Objection to the

You would have to check with him.

10

I can tell you why I think she is a liar, I'm

11

happy to do that.

12
13

Q.

Did he tell you he did not have

sexual relations with Virginia Roberts?

14

A.

I can only testify what I know.

15

Q.

I'm asking, has he told you that he

16

did not have sexual relations with Virginia

17

Roberts?

18

A.

I can only tell you what I know

19

about Virginia Roberts, I cannot tell you

20

what he knows about Virginia Roberts.

21

Q.

I'm asking, did he tell you that he

22

did not have sexual relations with Virginia

23

Roberts?

24

A.

All he told me is she is a liar.

25

Q.

That's all he said about Virginia

Roberts?

3

A.

We went through all the lies that

you have sold to the papers and sold in

general and we have analyzed her lies and

your lies and your inappropriate behavior in

7

detail.

Q.

I understand what you said.

I'm

asking you a question.

I just testified that we went

through all of her lies.

12
13

Did he ever say that he did not

Did he ever tell you that he never
had sex with Virginia Roberts?

A.

I don't recall whether he ever -- I

17

don't know I ever had that question.

19

him as relates to me.

asking him about his problems with her.

Q.

We

I'm

Did you also talk about what things

23

that Virginia Roberts was saying that were

24

true?

25

A.

There isn't anything that she said

5
6

G Maxwell - Confidential
that was true.
Q.

Nothing she said that you are aware

of is true?
A.

I think she is correct when she

talks about what her name is.

7

Q.

Anything else?

8

A.

I'm sure there must be one or two

9

other details but they are so far and few

10

between, I would have to look in detail at

11

all of her allegations to pinpoint what

12

possibly could be true.

13
14
15
16
17

Q.

Did you ever ask Jeffrey if he had

sex with minors?
A.

I have never been asked that

question.
Q.

18

You never asked him that question.
What analysis did Jeffrey do to

19

determine that the statements Virginia

20

Roberts were making were lies?

MR. PAGLIUCA:

11

MS. McCAWLEY:

The court ruled she

is entitled and you had to produce

documents about communications with

Jeffrey, that's what I'm asking about.

15

I'm not asking about communications with

Q.

I'm asking what analysis did

Jeffrey do to determine that the statements

19

that Virginia Roberts was making were lies,

21

MR. PAGLIUCA:

My objection is to

22

23

privileged communication from a lawyer,

25

one of her lawyers or a privileged

To the extent she has

Do you understand?
So if it was a conversation with a

10

lawyer which I'm not asking about, I don't

11

want you to tell me about your conversations

with lawyers.

13

I want you to tell me whether

14

Jeffrey Epstein ever told you what he

15

analyzed in order to determine which of -- of

16

what Virginia were saying were lies?

17

A.

18
19
20

I do not know what he did, no.
So you agree she is lying, Singrid.

Q.

I do not agree with that and I'm

asking the questions.

21

A.

You just said her lies.

22

Q.

I'm repeating a statement you made.

When you were saying that she was,

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Objection to the

6

A.

First of all, we can all agree

7

here, all of you sitting here that the lies

8

that you perpetrated in the press that she

9

was 15 and we should all agree now that that

10

is fake, a lie that was perpetrated between

11

all of you to make the story more exciting,

12

can we agree on that?

13

Q.

That is not my question.

14

A.

Can we agree she was not the age

15

she said and you put that in the press, that

16

is obviously, manifestly, absolutely, totally

17

a lie.

MS. McCAWLEY:

You have given me plane records

that has her name on it but as I already

testified those aren't federally mandated

3

things and I can see her name on it but

4

that's what I -- I told you I don't recall

5

her on any planes.

6
7

Q.

Is is that one of Virginia's

obvious lies?

8

A.

There are more obvious ones.

9

Q.

Is that one of them?

10

A.

I can't testify to her being on a

plane or not.

12

Q.

So is that an obvious lie?

A.

There are more obvious lies, like

I understand there are more obvious

I'm asking you, is the fact that she

17

said she traveled on Epstein's planes an

18

obvious lie?

19

A.

I think we can probably say because

20

you see her name on a plane record and she

21

went from A to B, that would not be the

obvious lie that I would pick.

What obvious lie were you picking

There are so many that I would be

Let's go through them.

Q.

What part of that was an obvious

A.

The characterization that she said

lie?

10

that she said she was accosted.

11

like, as best as I can recall, if I met her

12

in Mar-a-Lago as she claims, she worked at

13

Mar-a-Lago, she claims, and her statement she

14

worked at Mar-a-Lago, she would have been

15

dressed as all the spa people in Mar-a-Lago

16

would have been.

17

impossible to identify her as someone other

18

than someone who worked at a spa.

19

many claims, she has been a bathroom

20

attendant, front of house attendant, we don't

know what she was, so her obvious lies are

her contradictory of her own personal

statements within that.

Let me make sure I

The first, in the first piece when

15

you were talking, I believe you said and

16

correct me if I'm wrong, that her

17

characterization of the first meeting at

18

Mar-a-Lago was an obvious lie.

19

What part of that meeting was an

20

obvious lie?

21

A.

By her own testimony, all her

22

various many different descriptions of what

23

she was or wasn't or where she was or wasn't,

24

they have all changed.

25

She was either front

2

what she was, so just by her own words, one

3

doesn't know what's true and what isn't true.

4

Q.

Are you saying what position she

5

said she was working in, is that what you are

6

considering the obvious lie?

7

A.

I said inconsistency within her own

8

statement from everything, so in the

9

beginning it starts off with different

10
11
12

statements.
Q.

Then I believe you said the second

piece was that she was driven by her father?

13

A.

I said she was driven by her

14

mother.

15

Q.

That's the obvious lie?

16

A.

It's an obvious lie to me.

17

Q.

You said why don't you state it in

18

your own words but the characterization of

19

how she was with Jeffrey, what about that is

20

an obvious lie?

21

A.

I was standing outside talking to

22

her mother so the entire story is a

23

fabrication.

24

Q.

25

Did she not have sex with Jeffrey

Epstein during that first massage?

MR. PAGLIUCA:

form and foundation.

4

A.

I was talking to her mother so...

5

Q.

Do you know whether that's an

6

obvious lie, whether she had sex in that room

7

or not?

8

A.

9

Her story about what happened --

let's also be -- the story as first hit the

10

press was that somebody else led her to

11

Jeffrey's room, it was not me and then it

12

turned to being me so we have an obviously

13

important inconsistency, lie in my -- that's

14

how I would characterize a lie.

15

me or somebody else, it can only be one or

16

the other.

Q.

It cannot be

Who is the other person she said

took her to the room?

A.

Why don't you ask her.

20

Q.

I'm asking you.

21

A.

How would I possibly know.

22

Q.

You are saying that's a lie.

23

A.

It was a lie in the papers, she

24

said it in the newspaper, it was in the

25

How do you know she wasn't

identifying you?

4

A.

She said somebody.

5

Q.

How do you know that somebody

6
7
8
9

wasn't you?
A.

Why did it suddenly become me, why

not say it was me and be done with it.
Q.

So it's a lie because she

10

originally may not have named you and then

11

named you later?

12
13

A.

It's obviously inconsistent to

somebody who wasn't me.

14

Q.

How do you know it wasn't you?

15

A.

I know it wasn't me because I was

16
17
18

talking to her mother.
Q.

But she then named you, is what you

are saying?

19

A.

That's an obvious lie.

20

Q.

She named you?

21

A.

It's an obvious lie because I

22
23

wasn't even in the house.
Q.

Is it an obvious -- who did lead

24

her up to Jeffrey's room while you were

25

talking to her mother?

She would have found her way on her

A.

I would suggest that that entire

own?

story never happened at all in any of its

form.

20

Q.

If you stood outside with the

21

mother, what did you think happened inside

22

then?

23

A.

I believe that somebody, it wasn't

24

me,

25

Jeffrey Epstein

probably took her to meet

Did Jeffrey tell you that?

4

A.

No but that would have been a

normal interaction.

to her mother the entire time.

We are talking about her

Q.

If I'm following you correctly,

17

you're saying she walked in and would have

18

gone to -- it's your assumption she would

19

have gone and talked to Jeffrey and left?

20

A.

When I was working for Jeffrey,

21

typically he would meet someone before

22

getting a massage from them to see if he

23

wanted to have a massage from them,

24

typically.

25

Q.

So he would not have someone come

up to the room and start a massage?

3

A.

He would not.

Q.

So the young girls in the police

You just said that Jeffrey Epstein

the masseuses before they gave massages, is

that correct?

A.

The word interview is making me --

I'm English, so you could have some

difficulty understanding the way I

communicate.

I'm using your word.

A.

Then I will reuse it a different

word.

He would meet them because receiving a

massage is something you want to make sure

you are comfortable with the person and so

You can be a professional masseuse

at 17 in Florida, so as far as I am aware, a

10

professional masseuse showed up for a

massage.

incorrect about that and your

mischaracterization of it, I think is

unfortunate.

teenagers who worked in his home.
Q.

You are aware of Virginia Roberts

24

and you've stated she was 17 and she worked

25

for him, correct?

 
Page 226
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

A.

No.

I did not state that at all,

3

you are mischaracterizing my words and what I

4

said.

5

What I said was that we can all

6

agree and I think at this point there is not

7

one person in this room, however much you

8

would like her to be younger, to say she was

9

not 17 because that has been a very offensive

10

thing that you have all done.

11

At 17 you are allowed to be a professional

12

masseuse and as far as I'm concerned, she was

13

a professional masseuse.

14

inappropriate or incorrect about her coming

15

at that time to give a massage.

16

characterization of her first time at the

17

house was to me an obvious lie, given it was

18

impossible for her entire story to take place

19

given I was speaking to her mother the entire

20

she was at the house.

21

Q.

So she was 17.

There is nothing

So it was impossible that day, that

22

first day she came and you were speaking to

You, again, are completely

5

mischaracterizing.

6

what I heard obvious lies about me and her

7

obvious lies about me are that she, as you

8

put out to the papers and every other which

9

way, went upstairs with her, didn't happen.

10

So that to me is an absolute, obvious lie.

11

also don't believe that her -- her

12

mischaracterization of the length of time she

13

was there because as I recall, she just met

14

with Jeffrey and then left with her mother.

15

That's my recollection.

16

Q.

I

So you were standing outside the

17

entire time that Virginia was in the house,

18

is that correct?

19

A.

That is correct.

20

Q.

So can you testify as to whether or

21

not, do you know either from Jeffrey or any

22

other source whether or not Virginia Roberts

23

had sex with Jeffrey on that first day that

24

she was at the house?

25

A.

We can categorically state,

 
Page 228
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

absolutely 1000 percent that she did not have

3

any type of sexual relations as described by

4

you in your court papers that took place

5

because those allegedly according to her lies

6

involved some aspect of me.

7

As I was standing outside with her

8

mother the entire time, her entire story is a

9

lie.

Therefore, to ask me what she did or

10

didn't do during that time, I can only

11

testify to what she said about me, which was

12

1000 percent false.

13
14

Q.

So let's not take the first time,

let's take the next time she comes.

15

A.

No no, how can do you that, when

16

the basis of this entire horrible story that

17

you have put out is based on this first

18

appalling story that was written, repeated,

19

multiply by the press that lied about her

20

age, lied about the first time she came, lied

21

about and characterized the entire first

22

time.

23

her story and appalled by the entire

24

characterization of it and I apologize

25

sincerely for my banging at the table

I have been so absolutely appalled by

 
Page 229
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

earlier, I hope you accept my apology.

3

borne out of years of feeling the pressure of

4

this entire lie that she has perpetrated from

5

our first time and whilst I recognize that

6

was -- I hope you forgive me sincerely

7

because it was just the length of time that

8

that terrible story has been told and retold

9

and rehashed when I know it to be 100 percent

10

It's

false.

11

Q.

So not the first time she came, but

12

the second time she came or the third time or

13

any time she came, did you ever participate

14

in a massage with her in Jeffrey Epstein's

15

room?

16
17
18

A.

I have never participated at any

time with Virginia in a massage with Jeffrey.
Q.

Have you ever participated at any

19

time with Virginia in any kind of sexual

20

contact or sexual touching with Jeffrey and

21

Virginia?

22

A.

I have not.

23

Q.

So we were going through the list

24

of obvious lies and you were talking about

25

the first time which I believe we have

 
Page 230

2

completed but you can add to that if you need

3

to.

4

What other obvious lies did

5

Virginia Roberts tell that you were referring

6

to in your statement?

7

A.

Oh my goodness.

8

can totally cover the

9

story that I flew him with

Well, I think we

10

there was a dinner with other people and that

11

entire thing is 100 percent fictitious.

to do it again, that I have never flown

15

any time, anyplace, at any time, to any part

4

A.

Q.

How do you know that?

6

A.

Jeffrey doesn't know him, I don't

never came to the island.

know him and I think had

9

during the period when I would have been

gone to the island

10

involved in organizing a trip, I would have

11

been aware of it.

12

Q.

So go ahead, you had another one.

13

A.

It would be easier if I could see,

14

do you mind if a take a reference at some of

15

these newspaper articles or you just want me

Q.

And have you talked to

about that picture?
A.

We discussed Virginia's entire tail

and he asked me if he even knew her.
Q.

So did

tell you that

he did not have sex with Virginia Roberts?
A.

He doesn't even know who Virginia

Roberts is.
Q.

Did he tell you that he didn't have

sex with her?
A.

It would be difficult to have sex

with someone you don't know.

18

Q.

He may not remember her?

19

A.

I think the inference is he didn't

20

know who she was, he didn't have any

21

recollection of her whatsoever.

22
23
24
25

Q.

Has

Can I go on on her obvious lies?

3

Q.

If you have more.

4

A.

I have -- her entire

5

characterization -- I took her shopping into

6

Burberry and bought her a very expensive

7

dress and if this photo were real and if this

8

is -- I would never -- the outfit doesn't

9

work at all so --

10

Q.

Do you not remember taking her

11

shopping or are you saying it's an obvious

12

lie, you know you did not take her shopping?

13
14

16

A.

I did not take her shopping.

I did

not by her a $5,000 handbag.
Q.

Did Jeffrey by her a $5,000

handbag?

17

A.

Her accusation was that I did.

18

Q.

Do you know if Jeffrey bought her a

19
20

handbag during that trip to London?
A.

I don't know what he did.

She

21

accused me, I can't physically remember

22

buying a $5,000 not for her, not for anyone,

23

not for me.

A.

I don't recall ever shopping with

Virginia.
Q.

Did you have more to go over or did

you want me to ask my questions?
A.

The entire characterization of what

7

took place in my house in London would have

8

been impossible.

9

Q.

Can I ask, do you still have it,

10

the picture of the London town home with you

11

in it, Giuffre 00407.

12

As you are looking at this picture,

13

Ms. Maxwell, as I'm looking at it it's on the

14

right-hand side, there appears to be a

15

picture hanging on the wall, do you recall

16

that in your London town home?

17

A.

It's a little difficult to see.

Q.

Do you recall having a picture on

19

the wall there by the room where you're

20

21

Do you recall on the left-hand side

Jeffrey enjoyed getting massages.

5

that is something we can all agree in this

room and within the context of that, very

7

infrequently I would go to spas and myself

8

happily receive a professional nonsexual

9

massage from a man and/or from a woman and if

10

that massage was something that I thought was

11

something that was good, I would ask if that

man or woman would come back and does home

visits.

At the point where I think that

there is somebody that has, can be either

whatever the job may be, pool, gardener, chef

5

and/or exercise instructor and I think they

6

could be good at whatever it is at whatever

7

skill that they had and they did a home visit

8

which would obviously be mandatory and Mr.

9

Epstein would meet with them and decide if he

10

wanted to have whatever skill it was that he

11

would do it and then he would then either

12

have them come back or hire them.

Of the people that I, male and/or

female that I brought were all appropriate

Over the age of 18?

Again, I'm not aware of anybody

Q.

So you are not aware of any

interstate or international transportation of

20

Q.

Earlier in your testimony, you

21

stated that Virginia Roberts was 17 at the

time you met her.

23

How do you know she was 17?

MR. PAGLIUCA:

form and foundation.

Objection to the
And to the extent

 
Page 281

2

that calls for a privileged response,

3

I'm instructing you not to answer.

4

Q.

5

How do you know Virginia Roberts

was 17 at the time you met her?

6

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Again, if you

7

learned that information from your

8

lawyer, I'm instructing you not to

9

answer.

10

A.

I will follow my counsel's advice.

11

Q.

Are you able to answer that

12

question without telling me information you

13

learned from a lawyer?

14

A.

I'm not.

15

Q.

So you don't have independent

16

knowledge that Virginia, according to your

17

statement, was 17 at the time you met her?

18
19
20

A.

Again, my lawyer has instructed me

not to answer.
Q.

I'm asking you a different

21

question.

22

knowledge, outside your lawyers, that

23

Virginia was 17 at the time you met her?

24
25

A.

Whether you have any independent

lawyers, I can only remember or testify to

what she --

MR. PAGLIUCA:

She is asking you a

4

different question.

5

than what your lawyers have told you, do

6

you have any knowledge about her being

7

17, that's what she is asking.

8

A.

9
10
11

She is asking other

I can't recollect where I got all

the information that I have that definitively
shows that.
Q.

Earlier in your testimony, I

12

believe you said all of us would know that

13

Virginia was 17 at the time you met her.

14
15

How would we know that?
A.

I think you know that by her own

16

dates, now that it was in 2000, so her entire

17

tail of me celebrating her 16th birthday is

18

clearly another giant falsehood.

19
20

Q.

But she was 16 and 17 that year,

wasn't she?

21

A.

Which year?

22

Q.

You said it was 2000.

23

A.

I think the information that I have

24

that indicates that definitively was

25

something that is privileged, so I can't

 
Page 283
1
2
3

G Maxwell - Confidential
share with you.
Q.

So you have privileged information

4

that definitively tells you that she was 17

5

at the time you met her?

6

A.

I believe I do.

7

Q.

How would we know that?

8

A.

What are you asking me?

9

Q.

Earlier today you testified that we

10

would know that she was 17 at the time that

11

you met her.

12
13
14

How would we know that?
A.

I imagine you have access to

exactly the same information that I do.

15

Q.

What is that information?

16

A.

Again, it's privileged, I can't

17

share it with you but you have been on this

18

case for, I don't know, much much longer than

19

I have and I imagine you have all the

20

information that I do.

21

Q.

Do you know whether your lawyers

22

have produced documents from you that would

23

show the age that Virginia was at the time

24

that you met her?

25

MR. PAGLIUCA:

To the extent that

 
Page 284
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

calls for a communication that you had

3

with one of your lawyers, I'm

4

instructing you not to answer that

5

question.

6

Q.

I assume you, as part of the

7

discovery process, had to collect documents

8

that were relevant to this action, is that

9

correct?

10

A.

I did.

11

Q.

Did you collect documents that

12

would show that Virginia was 17 at the time

13

that you met her?

14

A.

I think you have everything that

15

relates, that I had, contemporaneously per

16

what you asked for that I have that relates

17

to that.

18

Q.

Did you have a document that

19

identified that Virginia was 17 at the time

20

that you met her?

21
22
23

A.

You have all of the documents that

I had.
Q.

I'm not asking what documents.

I'm

24

asking, do you have a document that

25

identifies Virginia being 17 at the time you

 
Page 285

met her?

3

A.

4

have.

5

have.

You have every document that I
You have seen every document that I

6

Q.

That's not what I'm asking.

7

A.

I don't recall every document that

8

I gave you, so I don't know.

I would have to

9

look at every single document I gave you and

10

then review it but as I recall you have every

11

document that I have.

12

Q.

What are you planning to show the

13

jury that will prove that Virginia was 17

14

when you met her?

15
16
17

A.

Again that's privileged so I can't

share that with you.
Q.

If you're showing the jury, it

18

wouldn't be privileged, so is there a

19

document you have produced in this matter

20

that shows that Virginia was 17 at the time

21

you met her?

22

MR. PAGLIUCA:

She answered that

23

question already.

She said she doesn't

24

know, she has given you everything.

25

there is a decision -- assuming for the

If

 
Page 286

2

moment there is such a document, just

3

hypothetically, and assuming for the

4

moment that it is going to get produced

5

somewhere, if it hasn't already been

6

produced, obviously that would involve a

7

waiver, a future waiver of the

8

privilege.

9

the question.

10
11

Q.

I think that's the answer to

Has the document been produced, do

you know?

12

A.

You have everything that I have

13

given you, so if you can't -- if it's not in

14

those documents, I don't know what to tell

15

you.

16

Q.
documents?

19

Your lawyers haven't withheld any

A.

They are right here.

You can ask

them.

Q.

I'm asking you.

A.

I don't know what -- they're

specific, whatever you are actually asking

15

me?

Q.

18

Were you ever in a room with

Q.

Any kind of puppet?

Again, puppet, you know, there is

lots of types of puppets.

8

Q.

Any type of puppet.

A.

If you want to give me a

10

description of the puppet, I would be perhaps

11

be able to say.

12

Q.

Any type of puppet?

13

A.

Can you be more detailed?

14

Q.

Have you ever seen a puppet in

15

Jeffrey Epstein's home in the presence of

17

A.

My understanding of a puppet is a

18

small handheld item you have in a circus.

19

have never seen that.

20

Q.

I

Have you ever seen a puppet which

21

is defined as a movable model of a person or

Q.

How close was your relationship?

A.

We were very friendly.

Yes.

Q.

So you haven't talked to him like,

I did not.

How many times have you had either

direct or indirect, meaning, in the presence

I'm sorry, can you just --

13

Q.

Either in person or by phone or by

15

email, from December 30, 2014 until present.
A.

I can't really characterize that

16

but not very much.

17

in January when you filed your, whatever you

18

filed, where we spoke and then, since then

19

not much at all.

20

Q.

There was a period when

Can you estimate how many emails

21

you would have sent Jeffrey from the period

22

of December 30, 2014 to the present?

23

A.

Not very many at all.

24

Q.

More than 20?

25

A.

I really wouldn't be able to

 
Page 297

2

characterize it because it wouldn't be that

3

many.

I wouldn't know.

4

Q.

More than 50?

5

A.

It would be on the lesser side, not

6

on the more side.

7

Q.

Can you give me a number?

8

A.

I honestly couldn't.

9
10

I would be

guessing.
Q.

How many emails has Jeffrey sent

11

you from the period December 30, 2014 to the

12

present?

13
14

A.

I would say less emails, even less

emails than I sent him.

15

Q.

More than 20?

16

A.

I would say on the lesser side.

messages?

No.

How many phone calls have you had

9

with Jeffrey Epstein since December 30, 2014?

10

A.

Again, very few.

11

Q.

More than five?

A.

Probably as many as the few emails

Q.

You weren't involved in the

creation of this document.

10

Did you -- we talked earlier about

Mr. Epstein's house, I'm talking about the

Palm Beach house where you said there was a

That was not my job.

Q.

Did you ever do it?

I am not responsible for keeping

Q.

But did you ever do it?

I know

2

it's not your job but did you ever do it, did

3

you ever keep phone contact information for

him?

5

A.

During the course of the time we

6

were together, if he gave me a telephone

7

number, I would give it to an assistant to

8

put in the computer, I could do that.

have it -- I'm sure it happened.

19

Q.

Was there a hardcopy book in

20

addition to the computer, a hardcopy book

9

was there.

10

Q.

So when you were working for

11

Jeffrey Epstein, you were able to access this

12

book?

13

A.

This book -- if this is what this

14

is, I believe it was, this is the stolen

15

document from his house.

16
17
18

Q.

And you were able to access it when

you worked for him?
A.

It was a document that was printed

Are there any numbers on here or

I already testified that I'm not

22

Q.

Are there any names or numbers

You just don't remember doing that?

16

A.

I do not.

17

Q.

Now, as you look -- I want you to

18

take a look at the Florida massage list, it's

19

three columns there.

20

Do you, as you look at those names

21

on the various columns, do you know the ages

22

of any of the girls in this list?

23

A.

I don't know.

One, I don't know

book existed?

16

A.

Yes.

a number of masseuses listed under the

When you were there, were there a

3

massage section?

4

A.

When I was there, I would have, of

course there would have been some masseuses

6

listed but I could not tell you who or how

7

many and this -- I could not possibly because

8

I wouldn't remember.

Q.

Do you know why Jeffrey would have

had so many names listed under his massage

every day?

18

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Objection to the

20

Q.

You can answer.

21

A.

When I was there he had a massage

22

roughly every day, one masseuse, and mostly

23

he would have them at random times, so it

24

would be difficult if you just only had one

25

person, man, woman, for an adult massage, to

 
Page 325
1

2

come and be available for whatever time it

3

was.

4

that he could call for a massage because at

5

any given time the one that he called first

6

may not have been available.

7

So he would have more than one person

Q.

So would it typically be a

8

different person each day that would give him

9

a massage?

10

MR. PAGLIUCA:

11

form and foundation.

12

A.

Objection to the

based on availability.

girls on this list under massage Florida were

17

under the age of 18?

She, I don't think she was a

However, I believe

she stole money from somewhere where she

5

worked.

6

Q.

7

How do you know that was grand

theft?

8

A.

I don't know how I know that.

9

Q.

So you authorized a statement that

10

characterized that as grand theft without

11

knowing whether it was grand theft?

12
13

A.

What month, what is the date of

this?

14

Q.

The date of this is June 12, 2011?

15

A.

So I'm afraid such a long time ago,

16

I'm not sure how, I really couldn't testify

17

as to how that language ended up in here.

18

Q.

Do you have the police report?

A.

I don't know who has this document.

3

Q.

What's your basis in that statement

4
5

for saying Ms. Roberts fled the U.S.?
A.

Again, you are asking me for a

6

statement that I made in 2011 and I can't say

7

what in 2011 exactly the basis of that

8

statement was.

9
10
11
12
13

Q.

So you don't know whether or not

that statement is true?
A.

This is in 2011 and it never went

out, so I'm not sure exactly.
Q.

But you said in your email that you

14

were working to make it factually accurate,

15

is that correct?

16

A.

That's what it says.

Ms. Maxwell, do you recall being

subpoenaed for a deposition back in 2009?

I do.

14

Q.

Why did you avoid giving your

15

deposition in that case when you were

16

subpoenaed and had the opportunity to tell

17

your side of the story?

18

MR. PAGLIUCA:

Objection to the

20

A.

That's not what happened.

21

Q.

What happened?

22

A.

As I best recall, I was subpoenaed

23

and a date was set for the subpoena and

24

everything was set and I believe it was with

25

Brad Edwards, correct me if I'm wrong, and

 
Page 374
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

Brad Edwards failed to show up for the

3

subpoena.

4

Q.

So your testimony is Brad Edwards

5

did not show up for the deposition that had

6

been set?

7

A.

Correct.

8

Q.

Did you give any statement that

9

your mother was ill and, therefore, you

10

couldn't take your deposition and had to

11

leave the country indefinitely?

12

A.
situation.

That's an entirely separate
Brad Edwards was involved in the

14

, I

15

believe, you know, is when fake suits were

16

created in Jeffrey's case and
and Brad Edwards worked

18

for that firm.

19
20
21

Q.

And Mr. Edwards worked for that

firm?
A.

So when the subpoena came, Brad

22

Edwards was involved with

in the

23

case so when I was called for subpoena, then

24

and I had a subpoena, date and time set, Brad

25

Edwards went AWAL, meaning he failed to

 
Page 375
1

G Maxwell - Confidential

2

respond to calls and failed to get in touch

3

with my attorneys, even though a date and

4

time was set for the subpoena and so that's

5

what happened to that subpoena.

6

didn't happen.

7

Q.

It just

We may be talking about two

8

different cases so I will ask the question

9

again.

10

Was there ever a time where you

11

were subpoenaed to sit for a deposition that

12

you could not make it because you said that

13

your mother was ill?

14

A.

So that is the same subpoena that

15

Brad Edwards failed to turn up for and then I

16

think five or six months passed between -- a

17

period of time, I can't characterize it

18

exactly, a period of time passed where then

19

he resurfaced and asked for a new subpoena to

20

be -- a new time to be set and because he had

21

contacted the press and done all sorts of

22

things that you guys are familiar with, I

23

believe, it was my lawyer suggested that I

24

should have some sort of protective order and

25

I believe between the time for when Brad

 
Page 376

2

G Maxwell - Confidential
Edwards resurfaced after the
for

4

creating fake cases in Jeffrey's and other

5

people's cases, in between the time when

6

there were -- trying to figure out the

7

protective situation for me, my mother was

8

sick, she is 89, she was 89 at that time so I

9

-- they -- we can all -- we all have parents,

10

so anyone, I don't know how old your parents

11

are but any parent or godparent, any

12

individual who is in the late 80s 90s, we can

13

understand has health issues so my mother's

14

health was deteriorating very rapidly at that

15

time and we had issues at home with who she

16

would talk to and how to manage her, her

17

healthcare situation and so I went home.

18

They were still arguing about the protective

19

order --

20

Q.

Is it your testimony that there was

21

not a date set for your deposition at the

22

time you left to go see your mother?

23

A.

I don't believe so.

24

Q.

Are you friends with the

3

Did you attend a wedding of
a few weeks after the date was set,

4

let's say a few weeks after you left to go

5

see your mother who was ill?

6

A.

I don't recall exactly when I left

7

but it was before, a few weeks before -- I

don't remember the exact timing of that, so
